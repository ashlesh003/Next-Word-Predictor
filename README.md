# Next-Word-Predictor

## Overview

Next-Word-Predictor is an advanced AI-driven language model designed to predict the next word a user might type based on the context of the text they have already written. The model leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze input text, identify patterns, and generate predictions. This project utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning, making it a robust and context-aware word prediction system.

## Features

- **Context-Aware Predictions**: Suggests the next word based on historical context.
- **Real-Time Suggestions**: Provides fast and responsive predictions as text is being input.
- **User-Friendly**: Easily integrable into various applications for seamless user experiences.
- **Powerful NLP Model**: Utilizes deep learning models, such as LSTM, for accurate word prediction.

## Model Architecture

The architecture of the model is built using the **Sequential** model in Keras and consists of the following layers:

1. **Embedding Layer**: Converts words into dense vectors of fixed size.
2. **LSTM Layer**: Captures temporal dependencies in word sequences using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units.
3. **Dense Layer**: The output layer with a **softmax** activation function for multi-class classification.

### Model Compilation

- **Loss Function**: Categorical Cross-Entropy (for multi-class classification).
- **Optimizer**: Adam optimizer for efficient learning.
- **Metrics**: Accuracy for model evaluation.

## Requirements

- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Google Colab or any Python environment with GPU support for faster training
